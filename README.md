This assignment is based on your [processing-console-assignment-2-formatting-text-output](https://github.com/mariopineda/pde-console-2-formatting-text) assignment. Start by copying the code from your completed processing-console-assignment-2-formatting-text-output into the repository for this assignment.

In this assignment you will be displaying the same table as in https://github.com/mariopineda/pde-console-2-formatting-text, but this time you will display the table using the `text()` command in the canvas.

Specifications:
[ ] Displaying table on the canvas using the `text()` command
[ ] The x and the y position of individual text elements has to be calculated using x and y coordinates.
[ ] You have to use a suitable background image covering the entire canvas. The background image has to be partially [transparent](https://processing.org/examples/transparency.html).

## Bonus Challenge
Store team info, number of wins and losses in arrays and generate the whole table using for loops.
